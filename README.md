# GOMIL: Global Optimization of Multiplier by Integer Linear Programming
This project proposes GOMIL, a novel global optimization technique for designing better multipliers. The main idea of GOMIL is to establish an ILP formulation to jointly optimize the compressor tree and the prefix structure in a multiplier [1].
